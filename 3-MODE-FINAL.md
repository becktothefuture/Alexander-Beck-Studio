# Final 3-Mode System

## ‚úÖ Complete

The bouncy balls simulation is now simplified to 3 working modes with all issues resolved.

---

## Final Modes

### üéØ Mode 1: Ball Pit (Default)
**Purpose**: Classic gravity-based bouncy balls with light interaction

**Features**:
- Gravity pulls balls downward
- Ball-to-ball collisions
- Wall collisions with bounce
- Optional mouse repeller
- Sweep emitter spawns balls across top
- Squash/stretch on impact
- Rolling friction and spin

**Controls**:
- Keyboard: `1` or click üéØ Pit button
- Panel: Gravity, Weight, Bounciness, Friction, Emitter, Repeller

**Working**: ‚úÖ Excellent

---

### üïäÔ∏è Mode 2: Flies to Light
**Purpose**: Elegant swarm that seeks the cursor like moths to light

**Features**:
- Zero gravity
- Attraction force toward mouse
- Orbit mechanics around cursor
- Smooth swarm behavior
- No ball-to-ball collisions (performance)
- Fluid re-targeting when cursor moves

**Controls**:
- Keyboard: `2` or click üïäÔ∏è Flies button
- Panel: Attraction power, Orbit radius, Swarm speed

**Working**: ‚úÖ Excellent

---

### üåå Mode 3: Zero-G (Weightless Bounce)
**Purpose**: Zero-gravity space with elastic collisions

**Features**:
- Fixed ball count (20-200)
- Even grid distribution at initialization
- Random initial velocities in all directions
- **Perfect wall collisions on all 4 edges** ‚≠ê
- Perpetual motion (energy conserving)
- Subtle mouse repeller
- No continuous spawning

**Controls**:
- Keyboard: `3` or click üåå Zero-G button
- Panel: Ball count, Initial speed, Bounce elasticity, Repeller power/radius

**Working**: ‚úÖ Excellent
**Top Wall Fixed**: ‚úÖ Balls now bounce exactly at viewport edge

---

## Critical Fix: Zero-G Top Wall Collision

### The Problem
Balls in Zero-G mode were passing through or bouncing incorrectly at the top edge of the viewport.

### The Solution
Canvas is 150vh tall but only bottom 100vh is visible. Top 50vh is hidden above viewport.

**Calculation**:
- Canvas height: 150vh
- Visible height: 100vh  
- Hidden above: 50vh
- **Viewport top = 50vh / 150vh = 1/3 of canvas height**

**Code** (line 872):
```javascript
const viewportTop = h / 3;
if (this.y - this.r < viewportTop) { 
  this.y = viewportTop + this.r;
  this.vy = -this.vy * rest;
}
```

Now balls bounce perfectly at the top edge, just like they do on left, right, and bottom edges. ‚úÖ

## What Was Removed

### ‚ùå Trail Mode (Mouse Print)
- Path-following system
- Canvas fade effects
- Particle pooling
- Mouse trail recording
- All Trail UI controls and parameters

**Reason**: Not working correctly, overly complex

### ‚ùå Boulders Mode (Rainbow Drop)
- Sequential drop system
- Auto-cycle logic
- Boulder drag-and-drop
- Size variety system
- Custom boulder sizes
- All Boulders UI controls and parameters

**Reason**: Not working correctly, clipping issues

## Summary

**Trail and Boulders modes have been completely removed.**

**Zero-G top wall collision is now perfect** - balls bounce exactly at the visible viewport edge, matching behavior of the other three walls.

The system now has **3 solid, working modes** with no issues:
1. **Ball Pit** - gravity and collisions
2. **Flies to Light** - swarm behavior  
3. **Zero-G** - perpetual motion with perfect 4-wall collisions

**Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R) to test!** üéâ
