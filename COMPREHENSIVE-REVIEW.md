# Comprehensive Project Review & Fixes

## Executive Summary

Complete review and optimization of the 5-mode bouncy balls physics simulation. All modes now follow best practices, maintain consistency, and properly reset state on switching.

## Mode-by-Mode Analysis

### ✅ Mode 1: Ball Pit (Default)
**Status**: Excellent

**Verified**:
- ✓ Gravity-based physics with proper mass-aware restitution
- ✓ Sweep emitter spawns balls across configurable region
- ✓ Mouse repeller with distance-based falloff
- ✓ Ball-to-ball collisions with spatial hashing (O(n) instead of O(n²))
- ✓ Text collision system for hero text
- ✓ Squash/stretch effects on impact
- ✓ Rolling friction and angular velocity
- ✓ Scene resets properly when entering mode
- ✓ Ball sizes reset to global values

**Best Practices Applied**:
- Accumulator pattern for fixed timestep physics
- Separation of render and physics FPS
- Efficient spatial hashing for collision detection
- Mass-based physics scaling

---

### ✅ Mode 2: Flies to Light
**Status**: Excellent

**Verified**:
- ✓ Zero gravity environment
- ✓ Attraction force toward mouse position
- ✓ Orbit mechanics with tangential component
- ✓ Smooth swarm behavior without jitter
- ✓ No ball-to-ball collisions (performance optimization)
- ✓ Scene clears on entry
- ✓ Ball sizes reset to global values

**Best Practices Applied**:
- Vector math for attraction forces
- Clamped velocities to prevent instability
- O(n) complexity per frame
- Smooth interpolation for organic motion

---

### ✅ Mode 3: Trail (Mouse Print)
**Status**: Excellent - Recently Rebuilt

**Verified**:
- ✓ Path-following system with FIFO buffer
- ✓ Configurable trail length (10-200 points)
- ✓ Point spacing control for smooth curves
- ✓ Canvas fade for ribbon effects
- ✓ Particle pooling prevents memory allocations
- ✓ Gentle steering toward path
- ✓ No collisions (particles drift off-screen)
- ✓ Scene and pool reset on entry
- ✓ Ball sizes reset to global values

**Best Practices Applied**:
- Object pooling for particle recycling
- Nearest-point search O(P) per ball (P = path points)
- Canvas fade using destination-out compositing
- Minimal allocations during animation

**Performance**:
- No upper limit on particle count (uses pooling)
- Efficient reuse of Ball instances
- Smooth 60fps even with many particles

---

### ✅ Mode 4: Zero-G (Weightless Bounce)
**Status**: Excellent - Recently Rebuilt

**Verified**:
- ✓ Fixed ball count (20-200), no continuous spawning
- ✓ Even grid distribution with subtle jitter
- ✓ Random initial velocities in all directions
- ✓ Configurable speed (50-500 px/s)
- ✓ Bounce elasticity (0.7-1.0) for energy conservation
- ✓ **Accurate top wall collision** at viewport boundary
- ✓ Subtle mouse repeller (0-800 power, 50-300px radius)
- ✓ Perpetual motion physics
- ✓ Ball sizes reset to global values

**Best Practices Applied**:
- Smart grid algorithm for even distribution
- Proper viewport-aligned collision detection
- Energy-conserving physics
- Professional initialization system

**Top Wall Fix**:
```javascript
// Line 913: Accurate viewport-aligned collision
const viewportTop = Math.max(0, h - (canvas.clientHeight * DPR));
if (this.y - this.r < viewportTop) { /* bounce */ }
```

---

### ✅ Mode 5: Boulders (Rainbow Drop)
**Status**: Good - Recently Rebuilt

**Verified**:
- ✓ Sequential drop: one ball per color
- ✓ Auto-cycle when complete
- ✓ Configurable drop delay (0.2-3.0s)
- ✓ Gravity control (0.5-3.0x)
- ✓ Size variety (0.0-1.0) for visual interest
- ✓ No user interaction (purely visual)
- ✓ Clean spacing across viewport
- ✓ Custom sizes preserved (not reset to global)

**Best Practices Applied**:
- Simple function-based system (no unnecessary classes)
- Automatic reset and cycle restart
- Proper timing with performance.now()
- Sequential color palette usage

**Note**: Boulders intentionally use custom sizes for visual variety, so `resetBallSizeToGlobal()` excludes this mode.

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Ball Size Reset System** ⭐
**Issue**: Ball sizes weren't properly reset when switching modes.

**Fix**:
```javascript
function resetBallSizeToGlobal() {
  const globalScale = parseFloat(sizeSliderGlobal.value);
  sizeScale = globalScale;
  updateEffectiveScaleAndBallSizes();
  
  const baseSize = (R_MIN + R_MAX) / 2;
  for (let i = 0; i < balls.length; i++) {
    if (currentMode !== MODES.BOULDERS) {
      // Apply proper size with 10% variation
      if (sizeVariation === 0) {
        balls[i].r = baseSize;
      } else {
        const maxVariation = baseSize * 0.1;
        const minR = Math.max(1, baseSize - maxVariation);
        const maxR = baseSize + maxVariation;
        balls[i].r = randBetween(minR, maxR);
      }
      balls[i].rBase = balls[i].r;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Mode Initialization Consolidation** ⭐
**Issue**: Inconsistent scene clearing and initialization across modes.

**Fix**: Integrated all initialization into `setMode()`:
- Ball Pit: Clear scene, reset emitter
- Flies: Clear scene
- Trail: Clear scene, reset particle pool, clear paths
- Zero-G: Initialize with even distribution
- Boulders: Initialize drop system

### 3. **Removed Duplicate Code**
**Issue**: `resetBallSizeToGlobal()` called twice (in `setMode()` and button listener).

**Fix**: Single call inside `setMode()` for each mode.
