## Codebase Patterns
- Physics runs in `source/modules/physics/` - engine.js is the main loop, collision.js handles ball-ball collisions
- `getGlobals()` from `core/state.js` is the standard way to access shared state
- Wall system (wall-state.js) is FRAGILE - do NOT modify
- Build with `npm run build`, dev server with `npm run dev`
- For per-frame caching, use module-level objects with reset functions (see colorBatchCache pattern)
- Float32Array is efficient for trig lookup tables
- Mobile detection via isMobile || isMobileViewport is the standard pattern
- Build outputs to dist/ with ES modules (type="module" + modulepreload for shared.js)
- Rollup auto-splits chunks for code shared between entry points
