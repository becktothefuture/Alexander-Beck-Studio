Feature: Performance Bottleneck Fixes

## Codebase Patterns
- Physics runs in `source/modules/physics/` - engine.js is the main loop, collision.js handles ball-ball collisions
- `getGlobals()` from `core/state.js` is the standard way to access shared state
- Wall system (wall-state.js) is FRAGILE - do NOT modify
- Build with `npm run build`, dev server with `npm run dev`
- For per-frame caching, use module-level objects with reset functions (see colorBatchCache pattern)

## 2026-01-13 - TASK-001: Eliminate Per-Frame Map Allocation
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb6e4-9c3c-757f-b709-8b18db3a2d21
Task ID: TASK-001
- Added `colorBatchCache` object at module level in engine.js
- Created `getColorArray()` helper for array pooling
- Created `resetColorBatchCache()` to clear between frames
- Updated render() to use cached Map and pooled arrays
- **Files changed:** source/modules/physics/engine.js

## 2026-01-13 - TASK-002: Remove Collision Pair Sorting
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb6e4-9c3c-757f-b709-8b18db3a2d21
Task ID: TASK-002
- Removed `reusablePairs.sort()` call from collectPairsSorted()
- O(n log n) overhead eliminated - collision resolution works fine without sorting by overlap
- **Files changed:** source/modules/physics/collision.js

## 2026-01-13 - TASK-003 & TASK-004: Cache getGlobals()
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb6e4-9c3c-757f-b709-8b18db3a2d21
Task ID: TASK-003, TASK-004
- Verified: Both engine.js and collision.js already have optimal pattern
- Each hot function calls getGlobals() exactly once at the top
- No changes needed - code was already well-structured
