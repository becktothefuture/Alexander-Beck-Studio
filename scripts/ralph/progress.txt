Feature: Build Pipeline Overhaul: dist/ + Code-Splitting
Parent Task: 3

## Codebase Patterns
- Physics runs in `source/modules/physics/` - engine.js is the main loop, collision.js handles ball-ball collisions
- `getGlobals()` from `core/state.js` is the standard way to access shared state
- Wall system (wall-state.js) is FRAGILE - do NOT modify
- Build with `npm run build`, dev server with `npm run dev`
- For per-frame caching, use module-level objects with reset functions (see colorBatchCache pattern)
- Float32Array is efficient for trig lookup tables
- Mobile detection via isMobile || isMobileViewport is the standard pattern

## 2026-01-17 - Phase 1: Rollup Multi-Entry Configuration
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bcdf9-e424-715c-beac-2b4e6a2c270f
Task ID: 4
- Transformed rollup.config.mjs from 4 separate IIFE builds to single ES module multi-entry build
- Changed format from 'iife' to 'es'
- Replaced 4 separate configs with single multi-entry config using input object
- Set output.dir to 'dist/js' instead of output.file
- Removed inlineDynamicImports: true
- Added entryFileNames: '[name].js' and chunkFileNames: '[name].js'
- Implemented manualChunks function to route shared modules to 'shared' chunk
- Fixed splat entry path: source/splat/splat.js → source/splat-test.js (original path was incorrect)
- **Files changed:** rollup.config.mjs
- **Build output:** dist/js/ with shared.js (232KB) + app.js, portfolio.js, cv.js, splat.js + auto-split chunks (controls.js, panel-dock.js, etc.)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Original rollup config had a non-existent splat path - always verify entry points exist before configuring
  - Rollup auto-splits additional chunks beyond manualChunks for code that's shared but not explicitly configured
  - Circular dependencies exist in physics/modes - should be addressed in future phase
