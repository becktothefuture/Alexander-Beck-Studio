# 🎨 Control Panel - Final Organization

## ✅ Complete Reorganization Summary

The control panel is now **perfectly organized** with clear separation between global and mode-specific settings.

---

## 🌐 GLOBAL SETTINGS (Top of Panel)

These settings apply to **ALL 4 modes** - they affect the entire simulation no matter which mode you're in.

### ⚙️ Ball Properties
| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Size** | 0.75 | 0.1-6.0 | Ball size multiplier |
| **Size Variation** | 1.0 | 0.0-3.0 | Random size differences |
| **Weight** | 11.20 kg | 0.1-200 | Mass for physics |
| **Softness** | 40 | 0-100 | Squash/stretch on collision |

**Why these are global:**
- All modes use the same ball size system
- Weight affects physics in all collision modes
- Softness controls deformation in all modes
- Variation adds visual interest everywhere

### 🎨 Colors
- **8-color palette** with weighted distribution
- **Cursor color** selection
- All balls use this palette across all modes

**Why global:**
- Visual consistency across all modes
- Color scheme is part of the overall aesthetic

### 🖼️ Scene & Effects
| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Max Balls** | 400 | 50-1000 | Particle count limit |
| **Corner Radius** | 0 px | 0-200 | Rounded viewport corners |
| **Motion Blur** | 0.000 | 0-1.5 | Canvas fade/trail effect |
| **Blur Intensity** | 1.00× | 0-3 | Trail opacity multiplier |

**Why these are global:**
- Scene appearance applies to all modes
- Max balls is a performance/memory limit
- Motion blur is a visual effect overlay

---

## 🎯 MODE-SPECIFIC SETTINGS (In Tabs)

These settings **only apply when that mode is active**. Each mode has unique physics and behavior.

### 🎯 Ball Pit Mode

**Physics:**
- Gravity (1.1×)
- Bounciness (0.78)
- Friction (0.0025)
- Physics template selector

**Spawn Settings:**
- Emit interval (how fast balls spawn)
- Spawn Y, Width, X Center, Height
- Controls the top emitter position
- Spawn template selector

**Mouse Repeller:**
- Repeller active (checkbox)
- Repel size (200px radius)
- Repel power (24000)
- Repel softness (2.0 falloff)
- Repeller template selector

**Why mode-specific:**
- Only Ball Pit has gravity
- Only Ball Pit uses the top emitter
- Repeller is Ball Pit's mouse interaction

### 🕊️ Flies to Light Mode

- **Attraction Power** (1000): How strongly flies are pulled to cursor
- **Orbit Radius** (150px): Spacing around cursor
- **Swarm Speed** (1.0): Orbital motion speed

**Why mode-specific:**
- Attraction is unique to Flies mode
- These control the swarm behavior only

### ✨ Sparkle Trail Mode

- **Emission Rate** (3): Particles per frame
- **Particle Lifetime** (1.5s): Fade duration
- **Velocity Spread** (100): Initial burst size
- **Drift Strength** (50): Floating motion
- **Particle Scale** (0.6×): Size relative to normal

**Why mode-specific:**
- Sparkle emission is unique to this mode
- These control the sparkle physics only

### 🌌 Weightless (Zero-G) Mode

- **Initial Speed** (400 px/s): Starting velocity
- **Wall Bounce** (0.98): Restitution
- **Ball Count** (300): Scene population
- **Repeller Power** (800): Mouse push strength
- **Repeller Radius** (120px): Push radius

**Why mode-specific:**
- Weightless has its own initialization
- Different repeller than Ball Pit
- Ball count is mode-specific (not global max)

## 📊 Before vs. After

### Before (Confusing):
```
❌ "Global Physics" contained Ball Pit-only settings
❌ Spawn was "global" but only Ball Pit used it
❌ Repeller was "global" but Ball Pit-specific
❌ No ball softness control
❌ Settings scattered illogically
```

### After (Clear):
```
✅ True global settings at top (Ball Properties, Colors, Scene)
✅ Mode-specific settings in tabs
✅ Ball softness control added
✅ Logical grouping (related settings together)
✅ Clear visual separation (lines + headers)
```

---

## 🎯 Design Principles

1. **Global First**: Most important/common settings at top
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Mode details hidden in tabs
3. **Logical Grouping**: Related settings together
4. **Clear Labels**: No ambiguity about what affects what
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Separators + emoji icons

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

✅ **Global settings work in all modes:**
- Change size → affects all 4 modes
- Change softness → affects collision modes
- Change colors → affects all modes
- Change max balls → affects all modes

✅ **Mode settings only affect their mode:**
- Ball Pit gravity → doesn't affect Flies
- Flies attraction → doesn't affect Ball Pit
- Trail emission → doesn't affect others
- Weightless speed → doesn't affect others

✅ **Settings persistence:**
- All settings save to localStorage
- Refresh page → settings restored
- Auto-save after 500ms (debounced)

## 📝 Key Improvements

1. **✨ Ball Softness Added**: Global control for squash/stretch (0-100)
2. **🎯 Better Names**: "Ball Properties" instead of "Global Settings"
3. **📊 Logical Flow**: Most important settings first
4. **🔍 Clear Scope**: Obvious what's global vs. mode-specific
5. **🧹 No Redundancy**: Each setting appears once, in the right place
6. **📱 Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile (mode visibility)

## 🚀 Result

**A professional, intuitive, well-organized control panel** that makes it easy to understand and adjust the simulation! 🎉
