# Trail Mode Fix + Device-Specific Modes + Settings Persistence

## üñ±Ô∏è Trail Mode - Complete Redesign (STATIC PAINT)

### What Was Wrong:
- Balls were moving and fading
- Used HSL rainbow colors instead of palette
- Had reverse velocity causing explosion effect
- Collisions were enabled

### What's Fixed:
- ‚úÖ **STATIC paint drops** - particles stay exactly where spawned
- ‚úÖ **No movement** - velocity forced to 0 in applyTrailAttraction()
- ‚úÖ **No fading** - alpha stays 1.0 permanently
- ‚úÖ **Uses color palette** - same colors as other modes
- ‚úÖ **No collisions** - both ball-to-ball and wall collisions disabled
- ‚úÖ **Permanent trail** - paint stays until mode reset (press R)

### Result:
Move your mouse and leave a trail of static colored balls behind, like painting!

## üì± Device-Specific Mode Availability

### New System:
Created `MODE_AVAILABILITY` object to centrally control which modes are available on which devices:

```javascript
const MODE_AVAILABILITY = {
  [MODES.PIT]: { desktop: true, mobile: true },
  [MODES.FLIES]: { desktop: true, mobile: true },
  [MODES.TRAIL]: { desktop: true, mobile: false }, // DESKTOP ONLY
  [MODES.WEIGHTLESS]: { desktop: true, mobile: true }
};
```

### Implementation:
- Touch detection via `'ontouchstart' in window` and `navigator.maxTouchPoints`
- `applyDeviceSpecificModeVisibility()` hides Trail button on mobile
- Trail mode requires precise cursor control, not suitable for touch
- System is extensible - easy to add more device-specific modes

## üíæ Settings Persistence (localStorage)

### Features:
- **Auto-saves all settings** after 500ms delay (debounced)
- **Saves on page unload** (beforeunload event)
- **Restores on page load** - remembers your last session
- **Stores 30+ parameters** including:
  - Current mode
  - All slider values
  - Physics settings
  - Color template
  - Mode-specific parameters

### User Benefits:
- Settings survive page refresh
- Resume exactly where you left off
- No need to reconfigure every time
- Seamless workflow

### Technical Details:
- Storage key: `'bouncyBallsSettings'`
- Uses `localStorage.setItem()` / `getItem()`
- Graceful error handling (try/catch)
- Console logging for debugging
- 500ms debounce prevents excessive saves

## üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Test Trail Mode (Desktop):**
   - Press `3` to enter Trail mode
   - Move mouse around
   - Should see static colored balls left behind
   - No movement, no fading
   - Uses your color palette

2. **Test Mobile Hiding:**
   - Open on mobile device or use dev tools mobile emulation
   - Trail button should be hidden
   - Other modes still visible

3. **Test Settings Persistence:**
   - Change any slider values
   - Switch modes
   - Refresh the page
   - All settings should be restored

4. **Test Auto-Save:**
   - Open dev console
   - Move any slider
   - After 500ms, see "‚úì Settings saved" message
   - Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('bouncyBallsSettings')`

## üé® Trail Mode Behavior Spec

**Trail Mode creates STATIC PAINT DROPS:**
- Particles spawn at cursor position
- Zero initial velocity
- Stay permanently where placed
- No physics, no collisions, no movement
- Use standard color palette
- Only available on desktop (precise cursor needed)
- Clear trail with `R` key (reset)

Perfect for creating artwork!
